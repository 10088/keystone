    `[`blueprint policy-in-code <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/policy-in-code>`_]
    Keystone now supports the ability to register default policies in code.
    This makes policy file maintenance easier by allowing duplicated default
    policies to be removed from the policy file. The only policies that should
    exist within a deployments policy file after Pike should be policy
    overrides. To generate sample policy files from default values, prune
    default policies from existing policy files, or familiarize yourself with
    general policy usage, please see the `usage documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.policy/usage.html>`_
    provided in oslo.policy.
