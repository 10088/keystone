features:
  - The federated mapping engine now supports the ability
    to automatically provision federated users into projects
    specified in the mapping rules at federated login time. If the
    project within the mapping does not exist, it will be
    automatically created in the domain of the Identity Provider.
    This behavior can be done using a specific syntax within
    the ``local`` rules section of a mapping.
