    The catalog backend ``endpoint_filter.sql``has been deprecated in the
    `Ocata` release, it has been consolidated with the ``sql`` backend.
    It's recommended to replace the ``endpoint_filter.sql`` catalog backend
    with the ``sql`` backend. The ``endpoint_filter.sql`` backend will be
    removed in the `Pike` release.
