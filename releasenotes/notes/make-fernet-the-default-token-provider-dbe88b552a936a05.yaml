upgrade:
  - The default token provider has switched from UUID
    to Fernet. Please note that Fernet requires a
    key repository to be in place prior to running Ocata.
    This can be done using ``keystone-manage fernet_setup``.
    Documentation can be found `here <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/man/keystone-manage.html>`_.
    In addition, for multi-node deployments, it is imperative that
    a key distribution process be in use before upgrading. Once
    a key repository has been created it should be distributed
    to all keystone nodes in the deployment. This ensures that
    each keystone node will be able to validate tokens issued
    across the deployment. If you do not wish to switch token
    formats, you will need to explicitly set UUID as the token
    provider for each node in the deployment using
    ``[token] provider = uuid`` in your ``keystone.conf``.
critical:
  - If upgrading to Fernet tokens, you must have a key
    repository and key distribution mechanism in place.
    Otherwise token validation may not work. Please see
    the upgrade section for more details.
