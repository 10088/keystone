fixes:
  - Changed the default notification from ``basic`` to ``cadf``.
  - Added ``identity.authenticate.success``, ``identity.authenticate.pending``
    and ``identity.authenticate.failed`` as default for
    ``notification_opt_out``.
upgrade:
  - The default setting for ``notification_opt_out`` is changed to include
    ``identity.authenticate.success``, ``identity.authenticate.pending`` and
    ``identity.authenticate.failed``. If a deployment relies on these
    notifications, then override the default ``notification_opt_out`` setting
    by explicitly specifying the notifications to suppress.
