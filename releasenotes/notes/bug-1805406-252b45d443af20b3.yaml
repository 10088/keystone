    [`bug 1805406 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805406>`_]
    The ``GET /v3/users/{user_id`` API now properly returns an ``HTTP
    403 Forbidden`` as opposed to ``HTTP 404 Not Found`` if the calling
    user doesn't have authorization to call the API. This applies consistent
    authorititive policy checks to the API.
