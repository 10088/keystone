    [`bug 1805372 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1805372>`_]
    The following registered limit policy check strings have changed
    in favor of more clear and concise defaults:

    * ``identity:create_registered_limits``
    * ``identity:update_registered_limit``
    * ``identity:delete_registered_limit``

    These policies are not being formally deprecated because the
    unified limits API is still considered experiemental. Please
    consider these new defaults if your deployment overrides the
    registered limit policies.

    The registered limit API now uses system-scope and default
