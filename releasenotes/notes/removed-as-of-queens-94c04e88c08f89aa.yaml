    [`bug 1728690 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1728690>`_]
    The ``keystone-manage bootstrap`` command will only create the admin role
    and will no longer create a default member role. Please create any
    additional roles you need after running ``bootstrap`` by using the
    ``openstack role create`` command.
