    [`bug 1650676 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1656076>`_]
    A bug is fixed that could allow an authenticate call to not use the
    ``AuthContext`` object which has added security features to ensure things
    such as the ``user_id`` does not change between auth methods being processed
    in the Keystone server. The ``keystone.controllers.Auth.authenticate``
    method now requires the argument ``auth_context`` to be an actual
    ``AuthContext`` object. The scope of the fix is only tests, and this
    will prevent security regressions in the future. This is a
    hardening patch and not an exploitable security flaw.
