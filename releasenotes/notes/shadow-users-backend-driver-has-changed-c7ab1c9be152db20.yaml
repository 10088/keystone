  - |
    The abstract base class for the shadow users backend has changed. We've
    added a ``domain_id`` parameter to the ``create_federated_user`` method.
    This is so that the domain ID of the Identity Provider gets set for the
    federated user. If you have a custom implementation for the shadow users
    backend, you will need to add the new parameter to your method
    implementation.

    [`bug 1642687 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1642687>`_]
    Prior to this release federated users did not belong to a real domain. Now
    when federated users are created, as part of shadowing users, federated
    users will belong to the domain Id of the Identity Provider.
