    [`bug 1642687 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1642687>`_]
    When registering an Identity Provider (IdP) via the OS-FEDERATION API, it's
    now recommended to include a domain ID to associate with the IdP in the
    request. Federated users that authenticate with the IdP will now be
    associated with the domain ID specified. If no domain ID is specified, then
    a domain will be automatically created.
upgrade:
  - The ``domain_id`` is now recommended to be included when registering an
    Identity Provider (IdP) via the OS-FEDERATION API. For existing Identity
    Providers (IdPs), new domains will automatically be created and associated
    to the IdPs. Each IdP will now have a ``domain_id`` field. The new domain's
    ``id`` will be a random UUID, its ``name`` will match its ``id``. All
    automatically generated domains will be ``enabled`` by default.
