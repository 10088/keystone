    Removes RBAC protection from the `Self-service change user
    password` API (``/v3/user/$user_id/password``). A user is expected
    to know their own password and can be authenticated as such. This
    change is related to PCI-DSS features and allows a user with an
    expired password to change it without the need of an
    administrator.
