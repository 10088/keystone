upgrade:
  - The ``validate_v2_token()`` method has been removed
    from the token provider interface. The token provider
    API now uses other validation methods and translates
    v3 token responses to v2 format when needed. Having
    ``validate_v2_token()`` defined with the Ocata codebase
    will fail since the interface no longer includes that
    method. Please take this into consideration and plan
    accordingly if you're maintaining a custom token provider.
critical:
  - If writing a custom token provider, see the upgrade
    section about the removal of the ``validate_v2_token()``
    method.
