   [`blueprint strict-two-level-model <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/strict-two-level-model>`_]
   A new limit enforcement model called `strict_two_level` is added. Change the
   value of the option `[unified_limit]/enforcement_model` to
   `strict_two_level` to enable it.

   In this [`model <http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/keystone/rocky/strict-two-level-enforcement-model.html>`_]:

   1. The project depth is force limited to 2 level.
   2. Any child project's limit can not exceed his parent's.

   Please ensure that the previous project and limit structure deployment in
   your Keystone won't break this model before starting to use it.
