   [`blueprint strict-two-level-model <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/strict-two-level-model>`_]
   A new limit enforcement model called `strict_two_level` is added. Change the
   value of the option `[unified_limit]/enforcement_model` to
   `strict_two_level` to enable it.

   In this [`model <http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/keystone/rocky/strict-two-level-enforcement-model.html>`_]:

   1. The project depth is force limited to 2 level.
   2. Any child project's limit can not exceed his parent's.

   Please ensure that the previous project and limit structure deployment in
   your Keystone won't break this model before starting to use it.

   [`blueprint strict-two-level-model <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/strict-two-level-model>`_]
   The `project_id` filter is added for listing limits. This filter is used
   for system-scoped request only to fetch the specified project limits. Non
   system-scoped request will get empty response body instead.

   [`blueprint strict-two-level-model <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/strict-two-level-model>`_]
   The `include_limits` filter is added to `GET /v3/projects/{project_id}` API.
   This filter should be used together with `parents_as_list` or
   `subtree_as_list` filter to add parent/sub project's limit information the
   response body.
