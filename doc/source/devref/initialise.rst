Initializing Keystone
=====================

Before using keystone, it is necessary to create the database tables and ensures
the database schemas are up to date, perform the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ keystone-manage db_sync

If the above commands result in a ``KeyError``, or they fail on a
``.pyc`` file with the message, ``You can only have one Python script per
version``, then it is possible that there are out-of-date compiled Python
bytecode files in the Keystone directory tree that are causing problems. This
can occur if you have previously installed and ran older versions of Keystone.
These out-of-date files can be easily removed by running a command like the
following from the Keystone root project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ find . -name "*.pyc" -delete

Initial Sample Data
-------------------

There is an included script which is helpful in setting up some initial sample
data for use with keystone:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ADMIN_PASSWORD=s3cr3t tools/sample_data.sh

Once run, you can see the sample data that has been created by using the
`python-openstackclient`_ command-line interface:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export OS_USERNAME=admin
    $ export OS_PASSWORD=s3cr3t
    $ export OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
    $ export OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID=default
    $ export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=default
    $ export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    $ export OS_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5000/v3
    $ openstack user list

The `python-openstackclient`_ can be installed using the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install python-openstackclient

.. _`python-openstackclient`: https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/python-openstackclient
